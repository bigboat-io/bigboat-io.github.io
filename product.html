                    <h2>The State of Software Development</h2>
                    <p>Modern software teams are confronted with an ever-changing set of requirements, wishes and shifting focus.
                        On top of that, business demands that new features are quickly implemented and put into production without compromising
                        existing functionality and quality aspects.

                    <p>Often teams are also responsible for maintaining the acceptance and/or production environment by means of CI/CD pipelines. Teams need to not only develop the software but also have the capabilities to ensure the software can be put into production in a controlled fashion.

                    <p>HyperDev is built on top of Docker - the leading tool in containerization. The platform uses standards, such as docker-compose, to ensure a smooth transition to production and integration with all of your other services. Using Docker Swarm, we ensure maximum resource utilization.                    </p>
